This is a PoC over reveal.js to create a multi-user slideshow.

    - clone the repo
    - run npm install
    - run node server.js
    - open index.html in a browser window
    - open show.html in another browser window

Probably wont work in some conditions and the best server would have a way to enable multi presentations. Consider work in progress.

Test it here: (s.chu.pe)(http://s.chu.pe)

LICENSE and ownership of ideas still from original authors (this is basically the original reveal.js repo cloned and modified)


TODO: 
    - clean up html files, translate to a plugin or separated project
